Helsinki Bus Catcher
====================

This application displays all Helsinki trams and some buses moving real-time on an OpenStreetMap. Use it to determine when to leave for the bus stop, or just to enjoy the flow of traffic.

## Note: not for widespread use

The HSL web APIs are not yet production ready. This means that they shouldn't be used very widely, so treat this software as a proof of concept instead of something ready for the mass market.
